This set includes simulations where a change in the code has been done,
The change in this case is that the predicted slip is a FULL STEP PREDICTION:

Line: 2261
slip = dr_celldata[q].slip + dt * slip_rate;

and then the final slip and slip rate update is given by:
line: 2345
dr_celldata[q].slip += e_inelastic_xy;
dr_celldata[q].slip_rate = e_inelastic_xy/dt;
